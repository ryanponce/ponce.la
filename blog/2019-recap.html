    <h1>2019 Recap</h1>

    <p>December 23, 2019</p>

    <p>
      This year was a very busy year for me. Here are some of the big things
      that happened throughout the year.
    </p>

    <h2>January</h2>

    <p>
      Mentally prepared for another New York winter. Became a tourist in my own
      city and went to Rockefeller Center. Sandy went to Mexico to visit her
      sick grandmother. Survived a cold and windy snow storm that blew Sandy
      over outside of our apartment.
    </p>

    <h2>February</h2>

    <p>
      Some of my family came to visit, which included my dad, Diggy, Valentina,
      Alyssa, my Aunt Heidi, and Drew. We did a bunch of touristy stuff with
      them and rode bikes across a few bridges in Queens, Manhattan, and
      Brooklyn.
    </p>

    <h2>March</h2>

    <p>
      Sandy flew to Los Angeles for a few days to look at potential apartments
      for us. Enjoyed some nice weather in New York. Rode to Red Hook and
      visited a few spots there.
    </p>

    <h2>April</h2>

    <p>
      Sandy turned 26 and we celebrated at a
      <span style="color: dodgerblue">Dodger</span> game. We moved from Brooklyn
      back to Los Angeles.
    </p>

    <h2>May</h2>

    <p>
      Settled back in to Los Angeles living. Immediately hit up our classic go
      to spots (Bernadettes, DTLA Ramen, OB Bear, Apple Pan) and finally went to
      <a href="https://salazarla.com">Salazar</a>. The food was great, but the
      service was terrible. Will probably go back though.
    </p>

    <h2>June</h2>

    <p>
      Spent a nice weekend with Sandy at the Ace Hotel and Swim Club in Palm
      Springs. Saw Jaws at Cinespia in Hollywood. Rode Critical Mass with my Dad
      and Sandy at the end of the month.
    </p>

    <h2>July</h2>

    <p>Visited the Orange County fair and enjoyed a mild summer.</p>

    <h2>August</h2>

    <p>
      We had to put Walter down. He was just shy of 9 years old. Rode the
      Hollywood Ciclavia (East Hollywood to West Hollywood). Sandy got a nice
      new All City Space Horse bike.
    </p>

    <h2>September</h2>

    <p>
      Turned 30 years old. Celebrated at Disneyland with Sandy. She took to me
      the fancy

        >Carthay Circle</a
      >
      restaurant in California Adventure. My Dad told a story at the Moth on the
      theme of "cars". Signed back up for WOW Classic with Timmy. Went to
      Benihanna for my cousin Drew's 13th birthday.
    </p>

    <h2>October</h2>

    <p>
      Went to the Disneyland Halloween Party. It was at California Adventure
      this time. My family dressed up as Toy Story characters. I was Woody.
      Secretly got married at the Santa Ana courthouse. Traveled to Mexico City
      a few times in preparation for my wedding.
    </p>

    <h2>November</h2>

    <p>
      Diggy came to visit Los Angeles before going to Mexico City. I got
      married. Partied at Pujol and La Nuclear. Spent some time with my whole
      family in Mexico City. Visited Xochimilco finally. Sandy and I hosted a 12
      person Thanksgiving dinner in our apartment. We cooked a 20lbs turkey with
      the hits and 2 pies.
    </p>

    <h2>December</h2>

    <p>
      Got a 7ft. Christmas tree this year and transported from Home Depot to our
      apartment on top of Sandy's Mini Cooper. Went to the Moth where the theme
      was "Traditions". Celebrated Christmas Eve at my Mom's and spend the night
      in their RV. Christmas at my Nini's house. Saw James and Nikki in Irvine
      along with some of my old Acorns buddies.
    </p>

    <h2>Next Year</h2>

    <p>
      Going to Maui for our belated honeymoon. Hopefully going to buy a house.
